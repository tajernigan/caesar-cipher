# caesar-cipher

## Overview

This Program is meant to decrypt and encrypt messages using the caesar cipher

## How can you use this program?

- Make sure you compile the file "ceaser.cpp" and run in the same directory you have the "dictionary.txt" file in.
- If you would like to get test cases for the decryption aspect of this program you can run larger (or smaller) texts into the ecryption algorithm then plug that back into the decryption.
- Decrypting takes a lot longer than encrypting so expect longer run times for larger messages.
- Run time increases exponentially with respect to the size of the message.
